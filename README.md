### Prerequisites ðŸ“‹

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.\
Also you need to have installed [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/)

```
node@18.14.0 or higher
npm@9.2.0 or higher
gatsby-cli@5.6.0 or higher
```

I highly recommend `nvm`: it will make it very easy to set the node and npm versions.
